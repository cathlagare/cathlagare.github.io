I'm a PhD Candidate at the Department of Geophysics, Tohoku University, Japan, with an expected graduation in Summer 2025. My research interests are in tropical meteorology, focusing on mesoscale convective systems and their interactions with midlatitude cold air outbreaks, which significantly influence tropical convection. In particular, I explore how midlatitude air intrusions, known as cold surges, affect tropical weather, leading to extreme events and influencing broader climate dynamics.

By combining reanalysis data and high-resolution numerical simulations, I investigate the development and behavior of these mesoscale systems. My work aims to understand their connections to larger-scale atmospheric patterns, such as monsoonal circulations and global oscillations, aiming to improve predictions of severe weather events in tropical regions.

Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Hawaii.
