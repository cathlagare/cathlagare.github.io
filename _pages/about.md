Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working on tropical convection and its connection to intrusions of cold, dry air from the midlatitudes. My research examines how cold surges shape the structure and evolution of tropical mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), using a combination of reanalysis data and high-resolution numerical simulations. I’m broadly interested in how mesoscale processes link tropical and extratropical variability, as well as the role of air–sea interaction in these systems.

I completed my PhD in Geophysics (Summer 2025) at Tohoku University through a jointly supervised degree program with the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, under supervision of [Dr. Takeshi Yamazaki](https://wind.gp.tohoku.ac.jp/personal/yamaz/public_html/), [Dr. Junshi Ito](https://wind.gp.tohoku.ac.jp/personal/junshi/public_html/), and [Dr. Giuseppe Torri](https://giuseppetorri.com/). I am now continuing my postdoctoral research in the same group.

I’m always happy to connect, just send me an email.
