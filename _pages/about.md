Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Tohoku University, Japan. I am broadly interested in tropical convection, how mesoscale processes link tropical and extratropical variability, and the role of air–sea interaction in these systems. My research examines how midlatitude cold surges shape the structure and evolution of tropical mesoscale convective systems, using a combination of reanalysis data and high-resolution numerical simulations.

I completed my PhD in Geophysics (September 2025) at Tohoku University, Japan through a jointly supervised degree program with the University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa, USA, advised by [Dr. Takeshi Yamazaki](https://wind.gp.tohoku.ac.jp/personal/yamaz/public_html/), [Dr. Junshi Ito](https://wind.gp.tohoku.ac.jp/personal/junshi/public_html/), and [Dr. Giuseppe Torri](https://giuseppetorri.com/). I am now continuing my postdoctoral research in the same group.

I’m always happy to connect, just send me an [email](mailto:cathrene@tohoku.ac.jp).
