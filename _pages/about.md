Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Tohoku University studying tropical convection and its interaction with extratropical disturbances. I focus on how midlatitude cold surges influence tropical mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) using reanalysis datasets and high-resolution numerical simulations. I study how mesoscale processes bridge tropical and extratropical variability, and I am also interested in air–sea interaction. I completed my PhD in Geophysics at Tohoku University, Japan, in a jointly supervised degree program with the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, working with [Dr. Takeshi Yamazaki](https://wind.gp.tohoku.ac.jp/personal/yamaz/public_html/), [Dr. Junshi Ito](https://wind.gp.tohoku.ac.jp/personal/junshi/public_html/), and [Dr. Giuseppe Torri](https://giuseppetorri.com/). I am now continuing my postdoctoral research in the same lab.

I’m always happy to connect, just send me an email.
